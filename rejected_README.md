# Trivia API Project (UDACITY)
## Overview
Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.

This application:

1- Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.

2- Delete questions.

3- Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.

4- Search for questions based on a text query string.

5- Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.


## Getting Started 
### Pre-requisites and Local Development

Developers using this project should already have:

- Python
- Pip 
- node 

#### Backend 

inside the backend folder initialize and activate a virtualenv (for Windows users)
```
python -m virtualenv trivia_env
source trivia_env/Scripts/activate
```
>**Note** - In MAC, the `env` path `Scripts` is replaced with `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:
```
source trivia_env/bin/activate
```

then run ``` python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` All required packages are included in the requirements file (latest version used for the project).


To run the application run the following commands:

```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
The application is run on  ``` http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration.



#### Frontend

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the frontend directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```
$ npm install
```
The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use npm start. You can change the script in the package.json file.

```
$ npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.


#### Tests

To run the tests, run

```
drop database trivia_test
create database trivia_test
```
login into the database and run 

```
\i trivia.psql
```
to populate database

```
python test_flaskr.py
```

to run test

## API Reference

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,

```

The API will return three error types when requests fail:

400: Bad Request
